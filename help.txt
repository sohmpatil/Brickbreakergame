(Actually I have shared links of the first video of each tutorial)

Also I used the Wikipedia Page of the SDL2 Library

I used many google searches for creating the window

I used GIMP(GNU Image Manipulation Program) for image editing to convert other format files into bmp or else
Also I used converters on google for mp3 to wav format conversion
